# LimitedTimeTweak
Simple template to run the tweak until a certain date

# How to use
First, you %group your tweak
Secondly, in the %ctor you create an NSDate you dont want the tweak to be functional after
Thirdly, just compare [NSDate Date] with the date you created to see if it is before the date you specified to init your tweak

Extra:You can create files throughout the device to make it harder to bypass

That's about it.

**STAY SAFE :)**
