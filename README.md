# LimitedTimeTweak
Simple template to run the tweak until a certain date

# How to use
First, you `%group` your tweak <br><br>
Secondly, in the `%ctor` you create an NSDate you dont want the tweak to be functional after <br><br>
Thirdly, just compare [NSDate Date] with the date you created to see if it is before the date you specified to init your tweak 
<br>
<br>
Extra:You can create files throughout the device to make it harder to bypass <br>

That's about it. <br>

**STAY SAFE :)**
